<button class="collapsible">Smirne, Andrea----When can a quantum process be described classically?</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>More  than  90  years  after  the  inception  of  quantum  theory,   
the  question  of  which  traits  and phenomena  are  fundamentally   
quantum  remains  under  debate.  To make an example, quantum  
coherence is certainly a basic element of quantum mechanics, but the  
presence of coherences in the quantum description of a certain  
phenomenon does not rule out by itself an alternative classical  
description of the same phenomenon, as widely debated, e.g., within  
the context of possible quantum effects in biological systems [1]. In  
this talk, I will discuss definite criteria to determine when and to  
what extent non-classicality can be linked unambiguously to specific  
features of the evolution of an open quantum system and its  
interaction with the environment. In particular, I will consider the  
scenario in which a physical system is undergoing sequential  
projective measurements of one non-degenerate observable at different  
times and exploit the fulfillment of the Kolmogorov consistency  
conditions [2] to discriminate the resulting multi-time statistics  
from the statistics of any classical process. In the Markovian case,  
the multi-time statistics cannot be accounted for by means of a  
classical process if and only if the dynamics generates coherences  
(with respect to the measured observable) and subsequently turns them  
into populations [3].  On the other hand, such a direct connection  
between quantum coherence and non-classicality cannot be extended to  
general non-Markovian processes, where, instead, non-classicality is  
linked to the quantum discord between the measured system and its  
environment [4], as I will show by using the quantum-comb formalism [5].</p>

<button class="collapsible">Clark, Stephen----Modelling autonomous quantum thermal machines using mesoscopic reservoirs</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>An autonomous thermal machines interconverts energy without any moving parts by exploiting continuous steady-state currents of particles (e.g. electrons or photons) flowing through the working medium running between several thermal reservoirs. Increasingly experiments and applications are looking to miniaturise such devices to the nanoscale where quantum effects are prevalent. However, the precise characterisation of the performance of an autonomous quantum thermal machine necessitates knowledge of the non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) of the working system. If this system is composed of a small number of degrees of freedom that strongly interact with each other and are strongly coupled to the thermal reservoirs the calculation of the NESS is a formidable problem. There are two common approaches to this problem, (i) non-equilibrium Green functions that generalise Landauer-Buttiker theory for infinite leads coupled to an interacting system and (ii) open-systems theory based on Markovian Lindblad master equations which models the reduced dynamics of the system alone. For (i) highly involved Keldysh formalism is employed that requires either perturbative expansions or specialised diagrammatic resummations whose validity is not well-controlled. For (ii) issues arise with how to model in a thermodynamically consistent way the coupling to one or more baths. Local jump operators such as boundary driving can generate a NESS for two baths but fail to thermalise the system with one, while global eigenstate jump operators can't generate a NESS but can thermalize the system. In this talk I will present current work my collaborators and I are pursuing which bridges approaches (i) and (ii) allowing the NESS of interacting systems to be accessed numerically. Specifically, we discretize the spectral function of infinite thermal baths and include a limited mesoscopic number of degrees of freedom of the reservoirs in our "extended" system. These bath modes are then individually thermostated with Lindblad driving, while the system itself is coherently coupled to these modes. In this way our description allows for non-Markovian evolution of the system and interfacial deviations of the baths from idealised thermal states. We solve the open system dynamics using matrix product state methods specially adapted to this "impurity" problem. I will show that in the non-interacting limit this setup can reproduce Landauer-Buttiker theory to extremely good accuracy with ~50 modes in each bath. Crucially I will also demonstrate the wide applicability of the method by considering the performance of a simple quantum thermal machine with interactions.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Vacchini, Bassano----Quantum memory kernels from classical processes</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>We consider the general construction of master equations with memory kernel whose solutions are given by completely positive trace preserving maps. These dynamics going beyond the Lindblad paradigm are obtained with reference to classical renewal processes so that they are termed quantum renewal processes. They can be described by means of semigroup dynamics interrupted by jumps, separated by independently distributed time intervals, following suitable waiting time distributions. In this framework, one can further introduce modified processes, in which the first few events follow different distributions. A crucial role, marking an important difference with respect to the classical case, is played by operator ordering. Indeed, for the same choice of basic quantum transformations, different quantum dynamics arise. In particular, for the case of modified processes, it is natural to consider the time inverted operator ordering, in which the last few events are distributed differently. A connection to physical models like micromaser dynamics and collision models is drawn
